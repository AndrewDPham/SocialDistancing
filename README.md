# State-level social distancing policies in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus in the US

This is a routinely-maintained data repository for US state-level distancing policies to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19. It was developed and is maintained by researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. Our current update schedule is twice weekly, typically on Monday evenings (or Tuesday mornings) and Thursday evenings (or Friday mornings) PST. 

Note all data provided here are subject to updates or revisions based on continuing review of existing policy documentation as well as adoption of new policy mandates. All efforts will be made to clearly document and communicate any updates or revisions as they occur.

Analysis of these data is also ongoing; interested parties should contact us (see information below).
