## Data updates log

### April 14, 2020 (2:58 pm PST)  
**_State updates_**  
Our team completed its re-review of existing policy records for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The dataset uploaded today includes all relevant revisions based on the re-review of executive orders, as well as additions of new policies not previously captured. We also deleted some entries for which no documentation existed, or if the record was fully inaccurate.  

Full documentation of changes per location is in-progress. All policy entries where "LastUpdated" is 20200411, 20200412, 20200413, or 20200414 and includes notes in the "LastUpdatedNotes" indicate an update to the prior entry.

### April 13, 2020 (5:49 am PST)  
**_State updates_**  
Our team has begun a re-review of all existing policy records by state in an effort to cross-check sources, relevant dates (issuance, enactment, expiry), and policy coding (i.e., classification of each policy). Since our initial effort to capture state-level distancing policies (March 20-21, 2020), documentation has markedly improved as have online compilations of executive orders on government websites and elsewhere. The primary updates we see thus far are shifting dates by one day (e.g., re-review found that a policy was enacted at 11:59 pm on 2020031, so this was updated to 20200401 for "DateEnacted"), additional or amended gathering restrictions identified through document re-review (e.g., Utah's initial GathRestrictAny on 20200312 was revised to a non-statewide GathRecomAny following re-review of declarations and orders), and additional "OtherBusinessClose" mandates.  
  
As of today, we have completed the re-review of 23 states: Alabama through Hawaii, and South Carolina through Wyoming. Full documentation of changes per state is in-progress:

Quarantine length and who is covered by the policy can be found in the "PolicyNotes" column.

### April 1, 2020 (9:10 am PST)  
**_State updates_**
- **Alabama**: "OtherBusinessClose" issued 20200327, enacted on 20200328. This was not coded as "NEBusinessClose" because it listed a subset of groups of non-essential businesses to close rather than issuing a full closure mandate and detailing exceptions.    
- **Arizona**: "StayAtHome" issued 20200330, enacted on 20200331.    
- **Connecticut**: Fixed typo for "StatePolicy": was "StateAtHome" now revised to "StayAtHome".    
- **Florida**: "NEBusinessClose" issued and enacted on 20200330 for subset of counties. StateWide==0.
- **Idaho**: "SchoolClose" issued and enacted on 20200323. This was previously not coded as a full school closure; re-review indicated that the soft-closure involved requiring all students to not attend school in-person and schools move to distancing learning, constituting a state-wide school closure.    
- **Mississippi**: "StayAtHome" issued and enacted on 20200331 for Lauderdale County only. StateWide==0.     
- **Mississippi**: "NEBusinessClose" issued and enacted on 20200331 for Lauderdale County only. StateWide==0.    
- **Pennsylvania**: "StayAtHome" issued and enacted on 20200328 for Beaver, Centre, and Washington Counties. StateWide==0.  
- **South Carolina**: "OtherBusinessClose" issued and enacted on 20200331. Similar to the Alambama order, this was not coded as "NEBusinessClose" because it listed a subset of groups of non-essential businesses to close rather than issuing a full closure mandate and detailing exceptions.    
- **Tennessee**: "StayAtHome" recommendation (Mandate==0) issued on 20200330, enacted on 20200401. The order urges all persons in Tenneessee to stay at home rather than mandating them to do so, so this is not currently coded as a "StayAtHome" mandate.    
- **Tennessee**: "NEBusinesClose" issued on 20200330, enacted on 20200401.    


### March 30, 2020 (4:17 pm PST)

**_State updates_**

- **Maryland**: "StayAtHome" issued 20200330, enacted on 20200330.

- **Virginia**: "StayAtHome" issued 20200330, enacted 20200330.

### March 29, 2020 (5:16 am PST)

**_State updates_**  
_Full documentation is in-progress for March 29_
